{	What's this unit?														}{																			}{	MoreFiles libraries are built with the latest interfaces and libraries	}{	available to me. However, THINK Pascal's libraries have not been		}{	updated recently and so linking is a problem if a name in a libraries	}{	I link with changes.													}{																			}{	One of the things that changed recently is that UprString was renamed	}{	to UpperString in the libraries. Including this unit lets Think Pascal	}{	programs link with MoreFiles.											}{																			}{	Jim Luther, Apple Developer Technical Support							}UNIT UpperString;INTERFACE	PROCEDURE UpperString (VAR theString: Str255;									diacSens: BOOLEAN);IMPLEMENTATION	PROCEDURE UpperString (VAR theString: Str255;									diacSens: BOOLEAN);	BEGIN		UprString(theString, diacSens);	END;END.
